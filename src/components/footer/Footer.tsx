            1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
            configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
            eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
            eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
            value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase or added
            to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
            qualifying device matching the description provided when the
            estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on the full value of a
            new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires the presentation of
            a valid photo ID (local law may require saving this information).
            The offer may not be available in all stores and may vary between
            in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have additional
            requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to
            refuse or limit the quantity of any trade-in transaction for any
            reason. More details are available from Appleâ€™s trade-in partner for
            the trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and
            limitations may apply.
